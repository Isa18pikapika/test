        <p>Before we begin with the easy tips and tricks, I would like to give you a brief rundown of this game. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a free roam Legend of Zelda game. You begin on the great plateau, and throughout the game, you will need to complete trials to advance through the game. So with that in mind, lets get gaming!</p>

        <h3>5 Tips to make your Breath of the Wild gameplay better.</h3>
        <ol>
<li><h4>Find Food</h4>
<p>I placed this first on the list because I cannot stress this enough. When you don't have food in your inventory, your gameplay will be very stressful, due to the fact that food is one of the only ways to keep your health up without having to pay. As you travel Hyrule, you will find that many places have an area where you can pay to rest in a bed and refill your hearts. Unless you wander Hyrule and sell nearly everything in your inventory anytime you come across a merchant, finding enough rupees to pay for these expenses can be tiring. </p>
</li>
<li><h4>Find a Horse</h4>
    <p>My second recommendation is finding a horse. During my gameplay, I have realized that having a horse as your traveling companion is quite easier than running around everywhere on your own. This is because you have limited stamina. If you are trying to run from a monster and you let your stamina wheel fully deplete, you will have to run slower than you normally would even when you aren't using your stamina wheel. Meanwhile, when you have a horse, you can escape with ease. Be careful though! When you use more than a horses full spurs, your companion will throw you off. </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Find Weapons</h4>
<p>Weapons can be useful. For combat and other things. When I do gameplay, I always try to keep a torch, an iron sledghammer, and an axe on hand. These are very useful. A torch can be used to light fires on tall grass and create and updraft you can use to soar(if you haven't gotten Revali's Gale yet). An iron sledgehammer can be used to break rocks and obtain rock salt, luminous stone, flint, amber, and valuable gems. An axe or any other weapon that has a sharp edge, such as a sword, can be used to cut down trees. Keep in mind that you should always keep a range of two-handed and one-handed weapons on hand.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Don't sell fire, ice, or electric items</h4>
<p>I put this on the list because something I have figured out is that if you use attacks that are elemental againts its opposite, such as an ice arrow on a lizaflo on Death Mountain, it will take it out in one hit. </p>     
    </li>
    <li><h4>Trade items with Beedle</h4>
        <p>When you capture a beetle and carry it around with you, you can talk to Beedle and he will ask you to give it to him. Not for free of course. He will give you a meal or elixir in exchange for a beetle. These can be useful when you don't have enough ingredients in your inventory to cook.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

        <p>Using this guide should make your gameplay more enjoyable and hopefully easier. I hope this helped!</p>
